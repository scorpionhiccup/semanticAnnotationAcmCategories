# Semantic Annotation of ACM research papers using ACM classification tree

**Semantic annotation** is done through first representing words and documents in the vector space model using word2vec and doc2vec implementations, the vectors are taken as features into a classifier, trained and a model is made which can classify a document with acm classification tree 2012 categories.

## Setup Instructions
```
    $ workon myvirtualenv                                  [Optional]
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Download the Dataset needed for ACM in the ACM Directory from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/91uc71wlhd4sg70/CS_Citation_Network.zip?dl=0).

## Building the Model
```
    $ python3 run.py
```

## Classifying the Model
```
    $ python3 classify.py
```
